Tic-Tac-Toe: The Ultimate Showdown of X’s and O’s! Welcome to the most intense battle in the history of simple games! It's Player X vs. Player O, and the stakes have never been higher (well, unless you're playing for a pizza, but that's up to you). This game is where strategy meets chance, where every move feels like the fate of the world rests on your shoulders... except it’s just a 3x3 grid.

-X goes first. Choose a row and column. -O follows. Keep going until one player lines up three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. -If no one wins, it's a tie. But no worries, there's always next time.
